# Ingress for our components
# Note that the nginx ingress path /foo matches /foo, /foo/bar etc.
# To get the equivalent on GCE ingress you need two rules /foo and /foo/*
# Nginx seems OK to ignore the extra *

#  rules:
# Unless you want to use hostname based ingress, it is better to leave the
# Hostname out so it works for all paths
# If you are forwarding from another load balancer, make
# sure the LB sets the appropiate X-forwarded headers
